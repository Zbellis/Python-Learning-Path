## Hacking, Cleaning, and Plotting Health Data
- Extracted years worth of Strava data using https://scottpdawson.com/export-strava-workout-data/. Follow this this turned my hundrends of recorded exercises into JSON then into an Excel doc. The file included upward of 500 rows of runs and other relevant workouts then ~20 columns that actually contained useful data. 
- Next I imported the Excel data into Jupyter Notebooks then cleaned the data using Python and Pandas. Special thanks to Michael's Python for Data Vizualization courses
- After cleaning the data I performed analysis' getting great insights that Strava Premium couldn't provide, such as my average running pace in minutes/mile
- Lastly I plotted the data and even ran Linear Regression on my data.
- I then used this information to train smarter, and run a 50-mile race with only six days notice!
